Memory, also commonly known as Concentration, is a classic memory-based card game in which all the cards in the deck are laid face down, and then two cards are flipped face up. The object of the game is to turn over matching pairs of cards.

This project represents the first opportunity to combine my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and apply that knowledge to developing a large project.
